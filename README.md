## Overview

I created a website from scratch using html and CSS 
using semantic code structures and other properties such as flexbox.
The website was made to best show case my skills with html and CSS. 
I showcased skill sets in pseudo classes by using hover to create
a shadow over my buttons and application cards. 
I utilized media query skills in making sure my website is shown
correctly on multiple screen sizes. I also played with different fonts from google fonts and
resized and rounded images such as my profile picture to show the way I
desired. I played with borders and different colors for my text and backgrounds to add 
more of a creative splash to my page. Over all I used many skills I have learned so far in my Web
Development bootcamp class to create the best website I could. 
  
## Lessons Learned

Some lessons I learned from this project is that designing and developing a website can be extremely time 
consuming and frustrating. I was very intimidated by the project at first but with help from google and my class mates
it became a breeze. It made me realize how much goes into every website I go to now and how important it is to have 
people you trust to go to help with issues you are having with your site. A different set of eyes can really help instead 
of banging your head against the wall trying to figure it out on your own.
